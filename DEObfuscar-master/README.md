# DEObfuscar
Open-source deobfuscator for 'Obfuscar' (http://obfuscar.codeplex.com/) written in C#. Most deobfuscation is done through DEObfuscar but you first need to run the protected app into DE4DOT for some renaming process.

# HowTo

 - First use De4Dot a simple drag'n'drop - > ![De4Dot](https://github.com/0xd4d/de4dot) 
 - Now you can use DEObfuscar.
